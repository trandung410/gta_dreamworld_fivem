# VB-AC v4.0: FiveM Anticheat by VisiBait#0712

## READ README.TXT BEFORE EXECUTING THE SCRIPT IN YOUR SERVER! OTHERWISE THE ANTICHEAT WON'T WORK!

### VB-AC [v4.0]:
[NEW] This version includes a "On Screen Menu Detection" IA, that analyses player's screen and looks for menus every 30secs.

[NEW - UPDATE] This is the most advanced of VB-AC, and includes exclusive features (Anti Aimbot, Anti TriggerBot, Anti Rape Players, Anti Taze Players, Anti Blacklisted Anims...)  

[NEW] Admin Menu (Using MenuV): https://github.com/ThymonA/menuv

[NEW] Anti Injection System (Type vbacinstall in server console)
